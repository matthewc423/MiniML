## MiniML


MiniML is an interpreter for a subset of the OCaml language and evaluates OCaml expressions under various operational semantics including substitution, dynamically-scoped, and lexically-scoped environment models through an initial OCaml parser that breaks down expressions into smaller subparts which are then evaluated recursively
